What happens when you initialize a repository? 

Why do you need to do it? Builds the .git folder which holds the metadata for this repository. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  staging is a collection of files that will be included in a commit.  The repository holds all the commits made. 
  the working directory is where all files are kept including the .git metadata direcory which tracks history and changes.
  Staging allows you organize the structure/file  of your commits
